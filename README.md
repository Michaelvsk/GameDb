## ℹ️ What is GameDB?

GameDB will be an app for organizing, browsing and wishlisting games of various gaming platforms, like console, PC, handhelds.

Currently it's in a very early pre-release state with most functionality not implemented, yet created entirly in my free-time.

It's also a project I use to learn [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui). It's a fairly new cross-platform UI-library for C#/.NET.
